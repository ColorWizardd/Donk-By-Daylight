## Donk By Daylight
A responsive Dead by Daylight soundboard that utilizes the Tesseract C++ API to fire off specific sounds for score effects, such as skill checks or killer stuns.

### Warning
As of now, the project is abandoned. All code is left up in case I find a way to make this practical, but the idea is a lot harder to implement than it seems.
